# LinkedIn_Project
 
On "Web Applications Technologies" class we built a Linked-in type of website building front-end and backend using React, Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB (MERN). Used JWT for authorization, SSL certificates, and RESTFUL API requests. We build a recommendation system using the Matrix Factorization algorithm, built from scratch, for posts and jobs.
